## Recommended VVV Site Creation Wizard

VVV-Dashboard comes built with references for [Variable VVV](https://github.com/bradp/vv), one of the best VVV Site Creation for WordPress Vagrants around. Variable VVV was created by [Brad Parbs](https://github.com/bradp) and its highly recommended that you install it to get the best out of VVV-Dashboard and your VVV WordPress Dev Environment. Some features of VVV you may like:

- Easily create sites with `vv create`
- Easily remove sites with `vv delete`
- Create `Blueprints` to set up different plugins, themes, mu-plugins, options, or constants that will be installed to a new site you create.
- Set-up deployments with `vv --deployment-create` that work with `vagrant push`
